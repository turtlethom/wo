Current Problem:

- Please use code above for reference

I want trackedSelection to allow the user to highlight/change background colors of cells within their current selection.
For Example:
    grid is 10 cells by 10 cells.
    If user selects "X", they have the option to highlight in any direction.
    // EXAMPLE OF CELLS IN PORTION OF GRID //
    A B C
    D X E
    F G H
    However, there should be restrictions to the user's selection. Here's some scenerios of cells selected:
    If "X" than "XE", user can only select horizontally in the direction selected, as "E" is horizontal.
    If "X" than "XA", user can only select diagonally in the direction selected, as "A" is diagonal.
    If "X" than "XF", user can only select diagonally in the direction selected, as "F" is diagonal.
    If "X" than "XB", user can only select vertically in the direction selected, as "E" is horizontal.

    I only want the user to change colors & select cells for trackedSelection if it qualifies these conditions, in all directions,
    with the given restrictions. Please assist me.

    Keep in mind, the trackedSelection logic is broken, if you come up with a solution, show me what to do about this older code.
